- 👋 Hi, I’m @tonimtnz
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, mostly I learned about front-end but nowadays i´m getting in love with backend and testing technologies (like JEST) and DB (PostgresSQL, MongoDB...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some new languages (like JAVA) and different frameworks to get more comprehension about how make my projects better every day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new proyects, that could be a good challenge for me after some works i`ve done last 8 months. Probably the one I feel more proud of it´s musiconnect, a final grade project of 2 months where I was selected to be the project leader and organize the work flow, the distribution of the responsabilities and the supevision of the aplication management on git.
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me could be via email (tonimartinezlluesma@gmail.com) or linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-martinez-developer/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I´m funnier when I don´t try.
- Extra: The most I learn, the less I really know. It sounds weird but its fun to see that I´m feeling my knowledge needs to be fill in the development world even when I realize that it´s imposible to know everything in this field.
